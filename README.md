# What is this project
This is the beginning of the story-reading and writing app I made as a personal project.

The idea is to combine the best of Visual Novel games and make them more accessible to accessible by elevating the Novel part of the equation - the highly personal text reading experience like one has with an e-book - while preserving the visual and audio elements in Visual Novels that authors must include to complete the experience.

At the same time, I want to build an app to provide a templating system for web-novel writers and artists to create their own stories and share them with the world.

# What is the goal of this project
Creating this app and building on it over time should be a valuable expreience.
I'm also developing my skills in the following:
- Svelte and SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript
- Headless CMS (Strapi v.4)
- Web-based 3D graphics (Three.js) and creating a pipeline for 3D assets

# What is the current state of the project
I have been working on this project solo since February of this year, but the first seed of an idea has germinated in my heads for years. After experiencing my love for the Visual Novel genre again via the game Arknights, falling in love with Webtoons and web novels, and finally becoming confident enough about my Web Dev skills, I decided to start it for real.
